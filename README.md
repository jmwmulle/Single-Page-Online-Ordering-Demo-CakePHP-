# xtreme-cake
An extensive mock-up of a dynamic, online-ordering system for restaurants. It was primarily built on the CakePHP rapid-development framework, the Foundation CSS framework and a boat-load of hand-authored Javascript. As a front-end developer, I apologize  for the glaring and incomplete security holes in this thing; as the project was never completed, this was the area of the  project most neglected and therefore least complete. There are fragments of OAUTH and and a user authentication system in place but little more. Still, intially setting up this extant code should follow CakePHP's basic conventions if you want to use it as a starting point for redesigning or improving upon what already exists. 

Note that while this was always intended to be responsive and design templates exist for making this functional on mobile and  tablet devices, it was designed first and foremost for the desktop user (1024px+) and was not developed further before the project was dropped.

This project was initially comissioned for a client who later withdrew their request for the work due to funding. 
I decided to proceed with it anyway as a portfolio exercise.

Note that it is *not* completed and littered with legacy code; this was a primarily solo project (thanks to github.com/RandomWord for serverside and security support whilst the funding lasted) that ought to have been a team effort. 
Many, many hours of writing and-rewriting, designing and re-designing were involved in the creation of this demo, 
hence the spattering of legacy code, dead functions and evolving design patterns/conventions that are sometimes found throughout the views and controllers. There's as much archaeology here as design, haha. 

While this is primarily a heavily modified CakePHP project, exploration of the /app/ directories will quickly reveal a lot
of re-invented wheels, so to speak. At the time, I was a novice in javascipt, jquery, responsive design and CSS3 (not to mention
how to use a task runner). Please forgive the mess of unused, uncompressed and poorly documented files. 

After the project's funding was abandoned, I confess that I too stopped maintaining the repo.

If anyone is interested into developing this into a generl framework I would be pleased to collaborate.

A *huge* amount of custom Javascript is responsible for the front end; again, a lot of this was experimenting to see
what scale of front-end engine I could devise on my own. The routing system, DOM management, etc. are all hand-written 
and of my imagination. Feel free to contact me to work through the arcana.

Cheers.
